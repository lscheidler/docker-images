# PIDFILE_CHECK_PID tells the script to double check whether the pid in the pid

# FIXED_COMMAND tells the script to use a hard coded action rather than
# expecting the first parameter of the command line to be the command.
# By default the command will will be expected to be the first parameter.
#FIXED_COMMAND=console

# PASS_THROUGH tells the script to pass all arguments through to the JVM

#  If not set then all arguments starting with the second will be passed.

# Wrapper will start the JVM asynchronously. Your application may have some
#  initialization tasks and it may be desirable to wait a few seconds
#  before returning.  For example, to delay the invocation of following
#  startup scripts.  Setting WAIT_AFTER_STARTUP to a positive number will
#  cause the start command to delay for the indicated period of time 
#  (in seconds).

# If set, the status, start_msg and stop_msg commands will print out detailed
#   state information on the Wrapper and Java processes.
#DETAIL_STATUS=true

# If set, the 'pause' and 'resume' commands will be enabled.  These make it
#  possible to pause the JVM or Java application without completely stopping
#  the Wrapper.  See the wrapper.pausable and wrapper.pausable.stop_jvm
#  properties for more information.
#PAUSABLE=true

# If specified, the Wrapper will be run as the specified user.
# IMPORTANT - Make sure that the user has the required privileges to write
#  the PID file and wrapper.log files.  Failure to be able to write the log
#  file will cause the Wrapper to exit without any way to write out an error
#  message.
# NOTE - This will set the user which is used to run the Wrapper as well as
#  the JVM and is not useful in situations where a privileged resource or
#  port needs to be allocated prior to the user being changed.

# Set run level to use when installing the application to start and stop on

#  be uninstalled before making any changes to the run levels.
# It is also possible to specify different run levels based on the individual
#  platform.  When doing so this script will look for defined run levels in
#  the following order:
#   1) "RUN_LEVEL_S_$DIST_OS" or "RUN_LEVEL_K_$DIST_OS", where "$DIST_OS" is
#      the value of DIST_OS.  "RUN_LEVEL_S_solaris=20" for example.
#   2) RUN_LEVEL_S or RUN_LEVEL_K, to specify specify start or stop run levels.
#   3) RUN_LEVEL, to specify a general run level.
